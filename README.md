## A NOTE ON WEB SCRAPING
Web scraping falls within a gray area of the law. Scraping data for personal use within limits is generally ok but you should always get permission from the website owner before doing so. This example here is very minimalistic in a sense (one request to Hera) so that it does not interfere with Heraâ€™s operations. <strong>Please scrape responsibly.</strong>
